Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js let's you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.

```jsx live="true"
() => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

```js fileName="some-file.js"
() => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello Javascript!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```
