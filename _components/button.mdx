Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js let's you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.

Custom components can be added in various places:

```jsx live="true"
() => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Here</h1>
      <Button label="Click me"/>
    </div>
  );
};
```
Or here
<Button label="Click me"/>
<br/>


```js fileName="some-file.js"
() => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Or here</h1>
      <p>To add theme to the live editor import them in the scope object in the LiveCodeEditor-Component</p>
      <Button label="Click me"/>
    </div>
  );
};
```
